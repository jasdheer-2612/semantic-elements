            <h2>Coding:</h2>
            <p>Coding is a process of identifying a passage in the text or other data items (photograph, image),
                searching and
                identifying concepts and finding relations between them. Therefore, coding is not just labeling; it is
                linking of data
                to the research idea and back to other data
            </p>Coding is a qualitative data analysis strategy that helps researchers:
            Define what the data is about
            Identify themes and the relationships between them
            Organize data so it can be examined and analyzed in a structured way
            Create analytic files
            Document and validate data across the research team

                <h2>Importance of coding:</h2>
                <p>Many people learn coding because of their career development, or simply because of their interests,
                    but the benefits are
                    much more than that. Steve Jobs once said, “Everybody should learn to program a computer, because it
                    teaches you how to
                    think.” When you know how to think, you open up endless possibilities to your work and life. Whether
                    you're a parent
                    looking for kids coding courses, or you're a working adult who's trying to upskill yourself, check

                    should learn to code below.</p>
